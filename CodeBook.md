# Code Book
This code book summarizes the variables in the data set tidy.txt.  
Listed below are the measurements and identifiers in the tidy.txt data set.

## Transformation performed to clean up data

* Replaced activity numbers with activity descriptions
* Updated feature labels
* Perfomed a cbind and rbind to bring all data together from the training and test files
* Extracted only the columns that measured mean or standard deviation, removed the Freqmean columns
* Modified the column labels to be more descriptive
* Prepared data for calculations by performing the following:  Removed any rows with missing values (since all subjects should have performed every activity). Changed the class on all measurement variables from character to numeric.
* Performed averages across subject and activity
* Added columns for the grouping labels (to assign the appropriate indicators of "subject" or "activity")
* Using rbind, brought the subject and activity averages together into one file
* sorted data by group_type


## Identifiers

__group_type__ - Identifies whether the measurement was performed on a subject_number or on an activity
* character field

__group_description__ - Identifies the subject number or activity the measurement was performed on
* character field
* subject number - One of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years
* activity - Each subject performed the following six activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
