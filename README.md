# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset - Average Measurements
# Version 1.0
=============================================================================

## Initial Study Design
The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  

 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.  

  
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured.  

  
The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.  


The magnitude of certain signal combinations were captured. 


All measurements were taken across a time and frequency domain.  


Several signals were captured during the study design:
* sensor signals - accelerometer, gyroscope
* sensor acceleration signal - gravitational, body
* jerk signal  
  
## Summary Design
### One R script was created called run_analysis.R that does the following.
#### Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#### Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  Any measurement variable with an original name containing "mean" or "std" were considered.  The only exception was a name containing "Freqmean", which was not considered to be a mean measurement, but rather a frequency.
#### Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  The activity descriptions replaced the original activity numbers.
#### Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  Each label was modified to spell out the signal, domain, etc.  
#### Creates a second, independent tidy data text file with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject that meets the following principles:  Each variable that is measured should be in one column.  Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row.  There should be one table for each "kind" of variable (Although, in this case the instructions specifically asked for one file).  If there are multiple talbes, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked.

## Packages required to run the R script:
* data.table
* lubridate
* dplyr
* reshape2

## For each record the following information is provided:

* A variable, called group_type, that indicates whether the summary mean was measured across subject number or activity
* A variable, called group_description, which indicates the subject number or activity description
* 73 variables across either subject number or activity that provide the average of each measurement

## This repo includes the following files:

### README.txt

### Code Book for tidy.txt
* Includes steps taken to transform the data and perform summaries
* Includes description, class and unit of measure of each column

### tidy.txt
* The resulting dataset that includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* This file was uploaded to the Coursera website (and is not stored in the repot).
* The command for reading tidy.txt in R would be: data <- read.table("file_path/tidy.txt", header = TRUE); View(data)

### run_analysis.R
* The R script that contains the code for performing the analysis.  
* Several comments were included within the script to define each step
